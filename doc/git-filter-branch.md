# git filter-branch

In addition to the change of the commits regarding their description or structure, there is also sometimes the need to intervene in the content part of a branch. This should remain the exception in any case, since these interventions usually completely rewrite large parts of a branch.

As an example a file is called in which accidentally during the creation of the Repos was taken up. It contains tokens and passwords for various services and must be removed from the repo. Simply removing the file is not enough, as it remains in the history of the branch.

In this situation, the file must be removed from every commit. For such cases, there is the so-called filter-branch in git that can take over this task. Let's look at the commands first and go into the details.

```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch secret.txt' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

This command is kind of a big deal in Git, it changes your whole history!

`git filter-branch`: This is a Git command that lets you change your whole Git history. Be careful, it's powerful.

`--force`: This tells Git to do the filter-branch, even if it thinks it's not a good idea.

`--index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch secrets.txt'`: This is what we want to do to each commit. In this case, we're telling Git to remove a file named `secrets.txt`. The `--cached` option means we're removing it from Git's history, not the actual file system. `--ignore-unmatch` is there so Git doesn't stop if it can't find the file in a commit.

`--prune-empty`: This makes Git remove any commits that became empty after our changes. An empty commit is a commit that doesn't change anything.

`--tag-name-filter cat`: This tells Git to not change the names of tags. `cat` is a command that just outputs what it gets, so it's not changing anything.

`-- --all`: This is the set of commits we want to change. `--all` means we want to change all commits in all branches.

So, all together, this command is telling Git to remove the file `secrets.txt` from the whole history of the repository and to delete any commits that become empty as a result. It's like that file never existed!
